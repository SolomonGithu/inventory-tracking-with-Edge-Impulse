## Monitoring inventory in retail with Edge Impulse and Renesas RZ/V2L :department_store:

![Cover Image]()

### Quick start :computer:

You can find the public Edge Impulse project here [Inventory tracking in retail with Renesas DRP-AI](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/165074/latest)

Ensure you have a recent version of Python then install the Edge-Impulse Linux Python SDK : 
```
 pip3 install edge_impulse_linux -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
```

Next, install Flask which is required to run the application.
```
pip3 install flask
```

Clone the repository to your target board
```
git clone https://github.com/SolomonGithu/inventory-tracking-with-Edge-Impulse.git
```

Navigate to the repository
```
cd inventory-tracking-with-Edge-Impulse
```
Start the application by running the following command while in the root directory of this repo:
```
python3 app.py
```

Alternatively, this Flask application has also been built as an executable for aarch64 (or amd64) Linux platforms using PyInstaller. This executable is in the ```dist``` folder. Run the commands below to start the executable:
```
cd dist && \ 
chmod u+x app && \
./app
```

### Rebuilding the executable :hammer:

If you want to update the application and rebuild the executable ensure [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) is installed. 

Since the RZ/V2L is of the AARCH64 platform, we need to ensure this is the target for the built executable. By default, the PyInstaller's bootloaders architecture defaults to the installed machineâ€™s platform. If you want to cross compile on a host computer you can do it by [building the bootloader](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/bootloader-building.html) for AARCH64.

Ensure that a terminal is in the parent directory of this repository and build the application with the command:
```
pyinstaller -w -F --add-data "templates:templates" --add-data "static:static" --add-data "modelfile:modelfile" app.py
```

If you see some warnings when looking for dynamic libraries in the build process, first run the command ```sudo ldconfig``` and build the application again.

Lastly start the application with the command :
```
cd dist && ./app
```
